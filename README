Quansheng UV-K5 emulator v0.1 
(c) 2023 Jacek Lipkowski <sq5bpf@lipkowski.org>

This program connects to a unix socket (default /tmp/sock1 )
and looks like a UV-K5 radio to radio programming software.

The radio eeprom is simulated by the file k5_eeprom_test.raw

This can be used to reverse engineer the eeprom contents by
observing how the original radio programming software changes them.

This can also be used to debug third party programming software,
like for example k5prog https://github.com/sq5bpf/k5prog

Note: this is a one-off hack which i wrote for my own purpose, 
horrible code which will cause your eyes to bleed, with no error
checking etc. 


Usage:

Te primary use is to connect it to an emulated serial port provided by
virt-manager. The serial port in virt-manager should be configured as a 
unix socket, with path /tmp/sock1

The virt-manager VM runs windows and the Quansheng programming software.


If you want to interface this with something else, then use the magic of
socat.


I usually use these steps:

- read configuration from radio by the windows programming software
- change something
- write configuration to radio
- see what bytes changed

The differences can be found by vbindiff, or the binarydiff script:

./binarydiff uvk5_original_eeprom.raw k5_eeprom_test.raw


Hope this is useful in your reverse engineering efforts :)
